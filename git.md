Git is tool which implements a form of Source Control management. Was made by the same man who made Linux Linus Torvald.

It is a way of allowing developers to go look at code at a point in time and revert code if and when mistakes are made. 

> Tip: It is highly recommended to avoid checking secretes into git. However it will likely happen at some point int time, have a plan in place to reset every secrete should such an incident happen.

## Git ignore

With python and other languages there are tmp files, and secretes we don't want in your source code repository. A `.gitignore` file excludes these files from the repository.

Here is repo which has good starting `.gitignore` files:
